# init.lua
My personal init.lua based on [ThePrimeagen's init.lua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

## Pre-requisites
`git` must be installed and on `PATH`.

## WSL Setup
This project is intended to automate building + setting up Vim and some useful plugins inside Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
Download & run the `install-nvim.sh` script (no need to clone the whole repo).
